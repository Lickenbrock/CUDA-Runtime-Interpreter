# CUDA example with kernels without templates, which will translate to PCH before PTX
The makefile works similar to the five stages of compiler pipeline, if clang is translating cuda code. There is a new extra stage before generating the PTX code. First the file will translate to the PCH form an then to PTX. Important is, that the "Header"-files with the kernels will ends with the extension .cu . Otherwise clang will not recognize the cuda syntax.
